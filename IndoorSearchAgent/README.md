# Indoor Search Agent

This is a Unity project I've been working on for indoor search and navigation. It's still a work in progress, but the basic setup is there.

## What's in here

The project uses Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and includes a main scene that I've been building out. There's also some tutorial info stuff that came with the Unity template, which I'll probably clean up later.

## Getting started

To open this project, you'll need Unity (I'm using a recent version, check the ProjectSettings if you need the exact version). Just open the `My project` folder in Unity and it should load up.

The main scene is in `Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity` - that's where most of the work is happening.

## Notes

- The Library folder is generated by Unity, so don't worry about committing that
- Same goes for Temp and Logs folders
- I've been experimenting with materials and scenes, so things might be a bit messy

If you're working on this with me, feel free to add your own notes here or reach out if you have questions!
